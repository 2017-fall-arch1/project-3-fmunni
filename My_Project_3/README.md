Project Description

For this project, I implemented a simple pong game with msp430. 

In this game, there are two players, one is red and the another one is orange. For this game I also showed the score after the ending of the game. I also showed the winner with sound.


Instruction: 
Enter the following command to play this game and my main program is in My_Project_3 :

1. go to the my folder directory which is project-3-fmunni 
2. $ make
3. make load (make sure that the msp430 is connected)
4. $ make clean

 References:
 I followed many demos that Dr. Freudenthal provided in our github website. I also followd different websites to  implement the move ball and to keep track of the score. Moreover, I also discussed and took suggestions from our 3 TA's. And Whenever I stucked to implement this game I took help from my friends and my classmates.
